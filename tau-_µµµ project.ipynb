These tau leptons to triple muons decays are said to be impossible in standard model. However it is interresting for rejection (or new physic!) to keep track of these kind of events.\nThis was originaly a contest made by CERN with more than 15 000€ cashprize and was supported by IFJ.\nI investigated some features of machine learning to try to see if some algorithm are more efficient or not.\n\n\nAs datasets are made with both MC simulations and real data, some verifications are necessary:\n* Some features can be attached more to MC rather than physics so we have to make sure we are learning on **physics** and not **MC artifacts**.\n* Each particle has its own mass. In an ideal world, one would just the mass of a particle to tell which particle it is. However, in reality, mass is an estimation, and it isn't a feature that scientists trust when building a model. Correlations with mass can cause an artificial signal-like mass peak or lead to incorrect background estimations. \n\nIn order to consider having a valid algorithm, the model has to pass some test (which I only adapted for my code, taken from here: https://www.kaggle.com/bdmj12/flavours-of-physics-3-competition-2 )."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can start with some
